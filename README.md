1. The `AppRoute` class is responsible for defining the app's routes and navigation structure.
2. The `GoRouter` is initialized with the initial route and various other routes, including routes for authentication, book details, search, and more.
3. The app uses nested navigators with the `StatefulShellRoute.indexedStack` to handle the main bottom navigation structure.
4. Each bottom navigation item is represented by a `StatefulShellBranch`, which contains its respective routes.
5. BLoC instances are provided to the relevant pages using `MultiBlocProvider` and `BlocProvider` widgets.
6. The app utilizes dependency injection (DI) to manage the creation and disposal of BLoC instances.
